# gui-lib

This is my in-house set of functions I'm using to do gui stuff. It features my soluion to storing usefull data assosiated to a particular gui. (and to keeping the definition of element and its handler close together.)

This problem has been brought up recently on forum so I've decied to put it up here.

Beware, the code had previously undergone several reworks so the logic and structuring of the code might not be crisp in places, where old and new collide. I've spent enought time on this particular code so that now I just accept it as it is thanks to the fact that it gets the job done.

##usage
Most of the usage is documented right in the script files, check comments in those, then see the ex_control.lua for usage example.
